# MyntraEcommerce_Analysis

 In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis on a large ecommerce dataset containing information about customer demographics, product categories, purchase behavior, and transactional data. Using Python, Pandas, NumPyrn, I cleaned and preprocessed the data, and conducted statistical analysis and data visualization to uncover insights and patterns.
